# NumericalRecipes-2020-3
Numerical Recipes in Astrophysics, Fall 2020, taught by Dr M.P. van Daalen, homework set 3.

Running run.sh downloads the data, executes all scripts, saves all plots and output in /plots and /output respectively. The exercises include:
- ex. 1 - minimising chi-squared and a Poisson log-likelihood, G statistic and KS test; *model-optimisation.py (reading data, n-dim simplex, simple integration and sorting, statistical tests, plotting)*.
- ex. 2 - calculating forces with FFT - Cloud-In-Cell initialisation, interpolating on a grid, DFT, (I)FFT, 3D-(I)FFT; *cic-fft.py (object-like CIC implementation, bit-reverse shuffle, 1D and 3D iterative (I)FFT, plotting)*.
- report.tex - report compiled in Latex produced at the end, contains explanations, equations, all code, output and plots.
